* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- I personally struggled with remembering to all the components to a command. For example I tried to push a branch without adding the origin to the whole command. So then I had to go back and redo it. I also didn't double and triple check my work with git status and I should make it a point to do so in the future.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- Git and Github workflow. Our GPS really laid out a whole roadmap to where we needed to go to complete the assignment. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- What questions didn't I ask my pair and guide ;). With John I asked him questions about what to do next and what command to use, to make sure my own train of thought was on the right path. It really helped to have someone say "Yes, you do that. Or did you do 'this'?" With Charlotte we both asked her questions about pairing and about the assignment in general. She really cleared up a mistake that I made about naming my directory and repository the same thing. A mistake I will not make in the future! 

* What still confuses you about Git?
- Workflow. I would say its confusing though, at this point I would say that it is unfamiliar. My unfamiliarity with git is what confuses me. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
- Wonderful! I was very nervous, underneath that nervousness I was excited. I got a really safe and calm vibe from my pair and guide, that made me feel comfortable to make mistakes and ask questions. I was confident in my ability to ask for help which I think translated to me having a good session at least on my part.
